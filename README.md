## 🚨 Important Notes

### ⚠️ #1 AI Pitfall: Code Duplication

**AI coding agents LOVE to duplicate code** instead of reusing existing styles,
functions, and components. This creates unmaintainable bloat.

**YOU MUST:**

- ✅ Check existing code BEFORE asking AI to create
- ✅ Explicitly tell AI to REUSE existing styles
- ✅ Review AI output for duplicates

**Read this:**
[Avoiding Duplication Guide](docs/prompts/avoiding-duplication.md)

### This Project Uses:

- **Eleventy 2.0** - Static site generator
- **Node.js 20** - JavaScript runtime
- **GitHub Actions** - CI/CD automation
- **Lighthouse CI** - Performance testing

### Code Quality Gates:

| Layer              | What It Checks              | When It Runs      |
| ------------------ | --------------------------- | ----------------- |
| 🎨 **Editor**      | Real-time errors            | As you type       |
| 💾 **Save**        | Auto-format code            | When you save     |
| 🪝 **Pre-commit**  | Lint staged files           | Before Git commit |
| 🤖 **CI/CD**       | Full quality check          | On push to GitHub |
| ⚡ **Lighthouse**  | Performance & accessibility | Before deployment |
| 🚫 **Duplication** | Code/CSS duplication (>10%) | Pre-commit + CI   |
