4. Celebrate successful commit!

**Time:** 20 minutes

**Learning outcome:** Errors are normal and fixable

---

### Activity 2: "DRY Detective" (Lesson 5 + Duplication)

**Goal:** Identify code duplication and refactor

**How it works:**

1. Show website with duplicated CSS (3 buttons with identical styles)
2. Students identify duplication
3. Refactor together using CSS classes
4. Run duplication checker to verify 0% duplication

**Time:** 15 minutes

**Materials provided:** Example "bad" code in
`docs/examples/duplication-demo.md`

---

### Activity 3: "Prompt Engineering Challenge" (Lesson 3)

**Goal:** Practice writing effective AI prompts

   - Submit solution via GitHub issue

**Time:** 25 minutes

**Prize ideas:** GitHub stickers, "CI/CD Master" badge

---

### Activity 5: "Lighthouse Optimization Competition" (Lesson 9)

**Goal:** Apply performance optimization techniques

**How it works:**

1. Start with low-scoring page (large images, no alt text, poor SEO)

3. Share optimization strategies
4. Highest score wins

**Scoring:**

- Performance: 40%
- Accessibility: 30%
- Best Practices: 15%
- SEO: 15%

**Time:** 45 minutes

---

## 📊 Assessment Ideas

- Students self-assess understanding
- No grades, just feedback

**Option 2: Weekly Check-ins**

- Brief surveys: "What's one thing you learned this week?"
- Identify struggling students early
- Adjust pace as needed

**Option 3: Code Review Discussions**

- Students post their commits to discussion board
- Peer review: "I like...", "I wonder...", "What if...?"
- Instructor highlights exemplary work

3. **Create example "bad" code** for debugging activities
4. **Prepare troubleshooting** sheet with common student errors

### Recommended Tools:

- **GitHub Classroom** - Auto-create repos for each student
- **Discord/Slack** - Quick Q&A and peer support
- **Zoom/Teams** - For live coding demos
- **GitHub Discussions** - Async Q&A attached to repo

## 💡 Tips for Success

### Do:

✅ **Test everything yourself first** - Run through all lessons before assigning
✅ **Share your own struggles** - Normalize that instructors make errors too ✅
**Celebrate small wins** - First successful commit, first deployed site ✅
**Encourage experimentation** - "Break things and fix them" mindset ✅ **Provide
real-world context** - Connect lessons to job skills

### Don't:

❌ **Rush through setup** - Week 1 is critical for success ❌ **Skip the
"why"** - Students need context, not just instructions ❌ **Ignore struggling
students** - Identify them early in Week 2-3 ❌ **Grade harshly on first
attempts** - Focus on learning, not perfection ❌ **Forget to update links** -
Run link checker before each term!

---

- What would you add/remove?

**End-of-course reflection:**

- Most valuable lesson?
- What will you use in future projects?
- What was most challenging?
