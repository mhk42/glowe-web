# Lesson 10: Troubleshooting & Debugging 🔧

⏱️ **Time:** Reading: 9 min | Practice: 10 min | Total: ~19 min 📚 **Level:**
All Levels 🎯 **Goal:** Learn to diagnose and fix common issues in your
development workflow

---

## 🚀 TL;DR

When things break (and they will!), follow this process: **Read the error →
Identify the tool → Check docs → Fix → Verify**. This lesson teaches you how to
debug like a pro.

---

## 🤔 The Debugging Mindset

### Golden Rules:

1. **Read error messages carefully** - They tell you what's wrong!
2. **Check one thing at a time** - Don't change 5 things simultaneously
3. **Google is your friend** - Copy exact error message and search
4. **Ask AI assistants** - GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT, Claude
5. **Version control saves you** - Use `git` to undo mistakes

---

## 📋 Quick Diagnosis Checklist

When something breaks, check in this order:

- [ ] **Step 1:** Read the complete error message
- [ ] **Step 2:** Identify which tool is complaining (ESLint? Eleventy? Git?)
- [ ] **Step 3:** Check if file exists and is in correct location
- [ ] **Step 4:** Check if dependencies are installed (`npm install`)
- [ ] **Step 5:** Check if you're in the right directory (`pwd`)
- [ ] **Step 6:** Try the simplest fix first
- [ ] **Step 7:** Search for the exact error message
- [ ] **Step 8:** Ask for help (with error details)

## 🛠️ Common Issues by Tool

### ESLint Errors

#### Error: "'x' is not defined"

**Full error:**

```bash
src/js/main.js
  5:10  error  'x' is not defined  no-undef
```

**Meaning:** Using variable that doesn't exist

**Fixes:**

```javascript
// Option 1: Define the variable
const x = 10;
console.log(x);

// Option 2: Fix typo
const count = 10;
console.log(count); // Was: console.log(conut);

// Option 3: Import it
import { x } from './config.js';
```

---

#### Error: "'x' is assigned but never used"

**Full error:**

```bash
src/js/main.js

```

**Meaning:** Variable defined but not used

**Fixes:**

```javascript
// Option 1: Remove it
// const unused = "hello";  ← Delete this line

## 🔍 Debugging Workflow

### Step-by-Step Process:

```
1. Error occurs
      ↓
2. Don't panic! Read error message
      ↓
3. Copy exact error text
      ↓
4. Identify tool (ESLint? Eleventy? Git?)
      ↓
5. Check this guide for that tool
      ↓
6. Try suggested fix
      ↓
7. Test if fixed
      ↓
8. Still broken? Search error online
      ↓
9. Still stuck? Ask for help with:
   - Exact error message
   - What you were doing
   - What you've tried
```

---

## 💡 Using AI for Debugging

### Prompt Template for AI Assistants:

```
I'm getting this error in my Eleventy project:

[Paste exact error message]

I was trying to: [Describe what you were doing]

Here's my file:
[Paste relevant code]

What's causing this and how do I fix it?
```

---

### Example:

```
I'm getting this error in my Eleventy project:

[11ty] TemplateContentRenderError: variable 'title' is not defined

I was trying to: Build my site after editing index.md

Here's my file (src/index.md):
---
layout: base.njk
---
# Welcome

What's causing this and how do I fix it?
```

**AI Response:** "You're missing the `title` field in your front matter. Add it
like this: ..."

---

## 🔧 Testing Your Fixes

### After fixing any issue:

```bash
# 1. Run relevant check
npm run lint:js      # If JS error
npm run lint:css     # If CSS error
npm run build        # If Eleventy error

# 2. Run all checks
npm test

# 3. If all pass, commit
git add .
git commit -m "fix: resolve [issue]"
git push
```

---

## 🚨 Emergency Fixes

### "Everything is broken!"

**Nuclear option (use carefully):**

```bash
# 1. Stash your changes
git stash

# 2. Clean install
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install

# 3. Verify clean state works
npm test

# 4. Restore your changes
git stash pop

# 5. Fix any conflicts
npm test
```

---

### "I committed something wrong!"

**Undo last commit:**

```bash
# Undo commit, keep changes
git reset HEAD~1

# Fix the issues
# ...

# Commit again
git add .
git commit -m "corrected commit"
```

---

### "My branch is a mess!"

**Start fresh from main:**

```bash
# Save your work elsewhere (copy files)

# Get clean main branch
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# Create new branch
git checkout -b feature/new-attempt

# Carefully add your changes back
# Test as you go
```

---

## 🎮 Practice Debugging (3 minutes)

### Challenge: Create and Fix Errors

**1. Create syntax error:**

```javascript
// src/js/debug-test.js
const message = 'hello'; // Missing semicolon
console.log(message);
```

**Run check:**

```bash
npm run lint:js
# Should catch missing semicolon
```

**Fix it:**

```bash
npm run lint:js -- --fix
# Auto-fixes!
```

---

**2. Create CSS duplication:**

```css
/* src/css/debug-test.css */
.test {
  color: red;
}
.test {
  color: blue;
} /* Duplicate! */
```

**Run check:**

```bash
npm run lint:css
# Should catch duplicate
```

**Fix it manually:**

```css
.test {
  color: blue;
} /* Keep one */
```

---

**3. Clean up:**

```bash
rm src/js/debug-test.js src/css/debug-test.css
git status  # Should show deleted files
```

## � Working Without These Tools?

### What if your team doesn't have automated quality gates?

**Reality Check:** Not every project will have pre-commit hooks, CI/CD, and
duplication detection. Here's how to maintain quality manually:

#### 1. **Internalize the Checklist**

Before every commit, manually verify:

```bash
# Run these commands yourself (no hooks to force you)
npm run lint         # Check for errors
npm run format       # Format code
npm test            # Run tests
git diff            # Review what changed
```

#### 2. **Develop Your Internal Quality Sensor**

Ask yourself before committing:

- ✅ Did I check for existing similar code?
- ✅ Is this code readable in 6 months?
- ✅ Would this pass code review?
- ✅ Did I test this change?
- ✅ Am I solving the root problem or patching symptoms?

#### 3. **Champion Quality on Your Team**

If tools don't exist, introduce them:

- Share this project as an example
- Add ESLint/Prettier (low-hanging fruit)
- Propose pre-commit hooks (easy win)
- Document quality standards
- Lead by example

#### 4. **Use Manual Tools**

Without automation:

- **Browser DevTools** - Test manually in console
- **Code Review Checklist** - Print and use for self-review
- **grep for duplication** - `grep -r "functionName" src/`
- **Markdown preview** - Check docs before pushing
- **Local testing** - Always run site before committing

#### 5. **Build the Habit**

**The tools taught you what to check—now you can check without them.**

Example routine:

```bash
# Your manual quality workflow
1. Write code
2. Run npm run lint (manually remember)
3. Run npm run format (manually remember)
4. Test in browser (manually remember)
5. git diff (review changes)
6. Commit if all looks good
```

**Key Point:** The tools taught you _what quality looks like_. Even without
automation, you now know:

- What ESLint would catch (unused vars, bugs)
- What Prettier would fix (formatting)
- What duplication looks like (DRY violations)
- What Lighthouse would measure (performance)

**You're not dependent on tools—you learned the principles.**
