# Lesson 9: Lighthouse CI 💡

⏱️ **Time:** Reading: 6 min | Practice: 5 min | Total: ~11 min 📚 **Level:**
Intermediate 🎯 **Goal:** Understand performance testing and optimization with
Lighthouse

---

## 🚀 TL;DR

**Lighthouse CI** automatically tests your site's performance, accessibility,
SEO, and best practices on every deployment. It provides scores and actionable
recommendations for improvement.

---

## 🤔 What Is Lighthouse?

**Lighthouse** is Google's automated tool for improving web quality.

**Tests:**

- ⚡ **Performance** - Loading speed
- ♿ **Accessibility** - Usability for all
- 🎯 **Best Practices** - Modern standards
- 🔍 **SEO** - Search engine optimization

**Score Range:** 0-100 (higher is better)

---

## 📊 The Four Categories

### 1. Performance ⚡ (Target: 90+)

**What it measures:**

- First Contentful Paint (when content appears)
- Speed Index (how quickly content loads)
- Largest Contentful Paint (largest element loads)
- Time to Interactive (when page becomes interactive)
- Total Blocking Time (how long page is unresponsive)
- Cumulative Layout Shift (visual stability)

**Why it matters:** Fast sites = happy users = better conversions

**Common issues:**

- Large images (not optimized)
- Too much JavaScript
- No caching
- Render-blocking resources

---

### 2. Accessibility ♿ (Target: 95+)

**What it measures:**

- Color contrast ratios
- ARIA attributes
- Alt text for images
- Form labels

- Low color contrast
- Missing form labels
- No skip links
- Poor heading hierarchy

---

### 3. Best Practices 🎯 (Target: 95+)

**What it measures:**

- HTTPS usage
- Console errors
- Deprecated APIs
- Secure connections
- Modern JavaScript

**Why it matters:** Follow industry standards for security and reliability

**Common issues:**

- HTTP instead of HTTPS
- Console errors
- Vulnerable dependencies
- Insecure third-party scripts

---

### 4. SEO 🔍 (Target: 95+)

**What it measures:**

- Meta descriptions
- Page titles
- Crawlability
- Mobile-friendliness
- Structured data
- Canonical URLs

**Why it matters:** Help search engines find and rank your site

**Common issues:**

- Missing meta description
- Missing title tag
- Not mobile-friendly
- Blocked by robots.txt
- No viewport meta tag

---

## 📁 Configuration File

**File:** `lighthouserc.json`

**What it does:** Configures Lighthouse CI thresholds and settings

**Our configuration:**

```json
{
  "ci": {
    "collect": {
      "staticDistDir": "./_site",
      "url": [
        "http://localhost/is117_ai_test_practice/index.html",
        "http://localhost/is117_ai_test_practice/about/index.html"
      ]
    },
    "assert": {
      "preset": "lighthouse:recommended",
      "assertions": {
        "categories:performance": ["warn", { "minScore": 0.5 }],
        "categories:accessibility": ["warn", { "minScore": 0.95 }],
        "categories:best-practices": ["warn", { "minScore": 0.95 }],
        "categories:seo": ["warn", { "minScore": 0.95 }]
      }
    },
    "upload": {
      "target": "temporary-public-storage"
    }
  }
}
```

**Key parts:**

- `staticDistDir` - Where built site lives (`_site/`)
- `url` - Which pages to test
- `assertions` - Minimum acceptable scores
- `upload` - Where to store reports

---

## 🏃 Running Lighthouse

### Local Test (Development)

```bash
# Build site first
npm run build

# Run Lighthouse
npx @lhci/cli@0.14.x autorun
```

**What happens:**

```bash
✓ Running Lighthouse CI...
  ✓ Collecting reports for 2 pages
  ✓ Testing http://localhost/.../index.html
  ✓ Testing http://localhost/.../about/index.html

Performance:     98
Accessibility:   100
Best Practices:  100
SEO:             100

✓ All assertions passed
✓ Reports uploaded: https://storage.googleapis.com/...
```

**View report:** Click the uploaded URL

---

### CI/CD Test (Automatic)

**Runs automatically** when you push to GitHub (in
`.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml`):

```yaml
lighthouse:
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v4
    - uses: actions/download-artifact@v4
      with:
        name: site
        path: _site/
    - run: npm ci
    - run: npx @lhci/cli@0.14.x autorun
      continue-on-error: true # Don't block deployment
```

**View results:** GitHub Actions → lighthouse job → logs

## 🔧 Common Optimizations

### Performance: Optimize Images

**Problem:** Large images slow load time

**Fix:**

```bash
# Compress images (use online tools or CLI)
# Example sizes:
# Hero image: < 200 KB
# Thumbnail: < 50 KB
# Icon: < 10 KB

# Also add width/height attributes:
<img src="hero.jpg" alt="Hero" width="800" height="600">
```

**Impact:** ⚡ Can improve score by 20+ points

---

### Performance: Minify CSS

**Problem:** Large CSS files

**Fix:**

```bash
# Already configured in our project!
# CSS automatically minified during build

# Verify:
ls -lh _site/css/style.css
# Should be small (< 10 KB)
```

**Impact:** ⚡ Improves load time by ~0.2s

---

### Accessibility: Add Alt Text

**Problem:** Images missing alt attributes

**Fix:**

```html
<!-- ❌ Bad (no alt text) -->
<img src="logo.png" />

<!-- ✅ Good (descriptive alt text) -->
<img src="logo.png" alt="Company Logo" />

<!-- ✅ Good (decorative image) -->
<img src="decorative.png" alt="" />
```

**Impact:** ♿ Can improve score by 10+ points

---

### Accessibility: Color Contrast

**Problem:** Text hard to read (low contrast)

**Fix:**

```css
/* ❌ Bad (low contrast) */
.text {
  color: #999; /* Light gray */
  background: #fff; /* White */
  /* Contrast ratio: 2.8:1 (fails) */
}

/* ✅ Good (high contrast) */
.text {
  color: #333; /* Dark gray */
  background: #fff; /* White */
  /* Contrast ratio: 12.6:1 (passes) */
}
```

**Tool:**
[WebAIM Contrast Checker](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/)

**Impact:** ♿ Can improve score by 5-10 points

---

### SEO: Add Meta Description

**Problem:** Missing meta description

**Fix:**

```html
<!-- In src/_includes/base.njk -->
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8" />
  <title>{{ title }}</title>

  <!-- Add this: -->
  <meta
    name="description"
    content="{{ description or 'Quality-first web development course' }}"
  />
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
</head>
```

**Impact:** 🔍 Can improve score by 10 points

---

### SEO: Mobile-Friendly

**Problem:** Not responsive on mobile

**Fix:**

```html
<!-- Add viewport meta tag -->
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />

<!-- Use responsive CSS -->
<style>
  img {
    max-width: 100%;
    height: auto;
  }

  .container {
    width: 100%;
    max-width: 1200px;
    padding: 0 20px;
  }
</style>
```

**Impact:** 🔍 Required for SEO score above 90
